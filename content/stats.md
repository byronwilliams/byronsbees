Notes:

- This chart is updated every time I do an inspection. 
- I look at colonies approximately every 2 weeks, though this may just be 
lifting the lid to see if an extra super needs adding
- Only frames of capped brood are counted. If I see 2.5 frames then I round down
and just say 2.
- These are aggregate numbers which include nucs, 2-6 frame mating nucs so the
full sized colonies will far exceed these numbers. For example in Apr 2020 the
average of capped brood frames is 2.37, yet the largest colonies I have are on 7
fully capped frames
