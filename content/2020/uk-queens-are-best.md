Please see [Importing Queens is Good](./importing-queens-is-good) for the 
counter to this article.

Bees want genetic variation, queens mate for 13.2 times for a reason. There is 
only a problem with importation if AI queens have a low variation.

There is already plenty of variation already here, why bother importing? We
already know that there

A beekeeper with just a few hives with average queens can still crop an above
average honey yield just from good management

Most arguments for using only UK queens are purely philisophical, they lack the
practicality of importing. Striving s 

- Lower carbon footprint
- Truely acclimatised to our country and specific region
    - The climate of the Caucaus mountains is not the same as here
- Engages the UK beekeeping community to create a self sufficient system
    - education, better educated beekeepers are better beekeepers
    - would encourage BKAs to supply queens and nucs from the local area, maybe
      this is something new starters could be involved in (the whole lifecycle)
- There is plenty of variation in existing stock with people getting lots of
honey from local stocks
- Reduces chance of disease transmission
- Queens are polyandrous by nature, they solve their issues with variation
- Support our local economies and skill of our bee farmers
