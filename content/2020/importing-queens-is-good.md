Some people feel very strongly that importing queens from abroad is wrong, but 
there are several reasons why English beekeepers would find it useful:

The supply for queens in the UK does not match the demand during the early 
season. Importing early season queens can help revive doomed colonies which have
become queenless or are laying drones. I'd rather spend £35 to replace a queen
rather than have to pay £200 for a new nuc.

According to (honeybee.market/stats) the average price of an EU queen is £37.84
whilst a UK queen is going to set me back £44

We are keen to help new members of our respective branches get started early in
the season. If nucs cannot be supplied by existing members they must be procured
from a larger nuc supplier, such colonies will often be headed up my an imported
queen marked with this years colour. 

Importing queens also allows one to relax in the knowledge that a supplier who's
job it is to raise well tempered productive bees has done the work for you. They 
have chosen the best of their bees from multiple lineages. They'll even arrive 
with a health certificate and often a batch number which you can trace.

Whilst raising queens can simply involve watching out for the bees natural 
swarming instinct to occur and then harvesting a few cells, one has no idea what 
type of colony you're going to get end up with in 6-8 weeks time, the 
professional queen breeder does. 

Experiencing 2nd/3rd generation queens which are aggressive is never fun so it's
simpler to replace them with a known good one and get on with beekeeping.

Totnes & Kingsbridge Branch members have on average 3 hives each. The majority 
of members are just interested in keeping bees and keeping those colonies going,
getting a queen from a reputable supplier when necessary is the simplest way to
continue beekeeping, rather than rearing a few queens yourself which may have
variable results.

England does not have any truly remote locations that can allow a strain of
bees to be bread in pure isolation. Dartmoor may be considered remote but there
are plenty of bees up there that are not of your strain. Islands in Denmark are
assigned to beekeepers in order to guarantee provenance.

Curiosity is a powerful motivator and by importing a different type queen you 
will expose yourself to different traits and patterns

Until the UK can step up its game and produce enough colonies for new 
beekeepers, work out a reliable way of overwintering mating nucs / small 
colonies and then provide them at a competitive price importing is a more 
reliable option for small scale beekeepers.

I feel that DBKA should follow the BBKA's lead and discourage the importation of 
queens and colonies whilst starting bee improvement groups in areas where there
is member interest (getting just one group to raise a hundred queens would go
a long way)
