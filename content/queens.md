            Blackawton Mated Queens (South Hams, Devon)
           <h2><b>Availabilty: Mid-May</b></h2>
           <h2><b>Price: Â£30 + P&P</b></h2>
           <h2><b>Marked: Yes, Clipped: No</b></h2>
           <h2><b>
                &gt; Order your queen
                </b>
           </h2>
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>

I score all of my colonies at every visit, I keep inspections and I record the
honey yield; I combine the results and get an overall colony score. 
Underperforming colonies will be replaced and new nucs will be built up with
queens from the best performing stock from 4 different apiaries.

The queen you will be buying will be mated and proved to be laying for a few
weeks before purchase.
