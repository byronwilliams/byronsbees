I have never been interested in taking a beekeeping assessment or really being
involved in an association as I have never wanted to be told how to keep bees.
I learnt to code before I went to University and that experience has moulded how
I write code (for the better). So now I am going to start looking at doing some
of the modules to cement in some knowledge.

So today on [Apisdex](https://apisdex.com) I have launched the ultimate quiz
on beekeeping knowledge that has hundreds of questions which have been checked
over by the NBU, Master Beekeepers and a few NBD holders.
