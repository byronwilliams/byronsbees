I purchased the Beekeeping Study Nodes by JD and BD Yates. 

The authors are quite forward with their beliefs about beekeeping. Some I will
share with you.

<hr />

## You must be trained

> "we regard it as an act of foolhardiness to keep bees without some formal training"

## Smoker between your knees

> "In our opinion, there is only one place for the smoker during a manipulation
> and this is between your KNEES"

## Only beekeep in your shorts

> "We are firmly of the opinion that if your bees cannot be handled without
> gloves and 'wellies' then there is something wrong with the bees or the
> handling techniques of the beekeeper"

I believe this gives a false sense of security to would be beekeepers. I should
hate to go down to the apiary as the weather turns and get stung because I was
not appropriately attired.

## Fair weather beekeeping

> "The manipulation or inspection should be carried out ideally on a warm sunny
> day with little or no wind and with a minimum ambient temperature of 15.5C. 
> The best time to open a strong stock is when most of the foragers are out 
> collecting nectar and pollen from the blossoms, this is said to be about 
> mid-day

With an average temperature in Plymouth being 16.2C during July and August that
doesn't give me much opportunity to look at my hives. These days would also
have to be at the weekend as I work during the week. My options seem rather
limited.
