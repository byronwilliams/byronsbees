title: Lot 2003 - Kington St. Michael Honey
date: 2020-06-24

> One of 80 jars of honey produced by a couple of colonies. It has been cold 
extracted and lightly filtered before going into this jar. I enjoy it in a honey
cake, added to rooibos tea or on a pancake. Thanks Bees!

My friends have a field between Leigh Delamere and Kington St. Michael. I've
never actually managed to work out which flowers the bees have visited to 
collect the nectar to create this honey. Whatever it is, the bees bring it in
during May. 

The honey takes a long time to crystalise which suggests nectar with a low
glucose percentage.
