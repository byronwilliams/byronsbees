title: Lot 2001 - Hemborough Post Honey

> This rapeseed honey was produced by one colony of honey bees. The bees had
plenty of luscious yellow fields, near the golf course, to forage from. I like 
this on waffles, crumpets and toast. Thanks Bees!

This is a mostly oil seed rape honey, it has small crystals and is still 
spreadable. The area around Hemborough Post, near Dartmouth, is a very popular
location to plant oil seed rape. Looking back at previous aeriel photos there 
are always many hectares planted up. The bees certainly do not have to travel
very far to fill up their honey stomachs
