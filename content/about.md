That's me! I keep 25 colonies of bees around Bath, soon to be Totnes. Normally
however I build websites at [Fika Studio](https://www.fika.studio). I also 
run [Apisdex](https://apisdex.io) which helps beekeepers become better beekeepers.

My brother [Dryden](https://www.drydenwilliams.co.uk) helps me out and my mum [Wendy](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/WendysCandles)
makes candles from local beeswax from around the country.

- If you have a **swarm** please contact the Totnes and Kingsbridge Beekeeping Association
- If you have some land you'd like bees on that's within 15 miles of Totnes
  then send me over some pictures and a description.
