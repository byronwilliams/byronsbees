That's me! I keep 20 colonies of bees around Blackawton in the South Hams, Devon.
Normally I build websites and API integrations at [Fika Studio](https://fika.studio). 
<!-- I also run [Apisdex](https://apisdex.io) which helps beekeepers become better beekeepers.-->

My brother [Dryden](https://www.drydenwilliams.co.uk) helps me out and my mum [Wendy](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/WendysCandles)
makes candles from local beeswax from around the country.
